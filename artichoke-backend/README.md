`artichoke-backend` crate provides a Ruby interpreter. It currently is
implemented with [mruby](https://github.com/mruby/mruby) bindings exported by
the [`sys`](src/sys) module.

## Execute Ruby Code

`artichoke-backend` crate exposes several mechanisms for executing Ruby code on
the interpreter.

### Evaling Source Code

The `artichoke-backend` interpreter implements
[`Eval` from `artichoke-core`](https://artichoke.github.io/artichoke/artichoke_core/eval/trait.Eval.html).

```rust
use artichoke_backend::prelude::core::*;
use artichoke_backend::prelude::*;

fn example() -> Result<(), Exception> {
    let mut interp = artichoke_backend::interpreter()?;
    let result = interp.eval(b"10 * 10")?;
    let result = result.try_into::<i64>(&interp)?;
    assert_eq!(100, result);
    Ok(())
}
```

### Calling Functions on Ruby Objects

`Value`s returned by the `artichoke-backend` interpreter implement
[`Value` from `artichoke-core`](https://artichoke.github.io/artichoke/artichoke_core/value/trait.Value.html),
which enables calling Ruby functions from Rust.

```rust
use artichoke_backend::prelude::core::*;
use artichoke_backend::prelude::*;

fn example() -> Result<(), Exception> {
    let mut interp = artichoke_backend::interpreter()?;
    let s = interp.eval(b"'ruby funcall'")?;
    let len = s.funcall(&mut interp, "length", &[], None)?;
    let len = len.try_into::<usize>(&interp)?;
    assert_eq!(12, len);
    Ok(())
}
```

## Virtual Filesystem and `Kernel#require`

The `artichoke-backend` interpreter includes an in-memory virtual filesystem.
The filesystem stores Ruby sources and Rust extension functions that are similar
to MRI C extensions.

The virtual filesystem enables applications built with `artichoke-backend` to
`require` sources that are embedded in the binary without host filesystem
access.

## Embed Rust Types in Ruby `Value`s

`artichoke-backend` exposes a concept similar to `data`-typed values in MRI and
mruby.

When Rust types implement a special trait, they can be embedded in a Ruby
`Value` and passed through the Ruby VM as a Ruby object. Classes defined in this
way can define methods in Rust or Ruby.

Examples of these types include:

- `Regexp` and `MatchData`, which are backed by regular expressions from the
  `onig` and `regex` crates.
- `ENV`, which glues Ruby to an environ backend.

## Converters Between Ruby and Rust Types

The [`convert` module](src/convert) provides implementations for conversions
between boxed Ruby values and native Rust types like `i64` and
`HashMap<String, Option<Vec<u8>>>` using an `artichoke-backend` interpreter.
