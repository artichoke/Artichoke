Artichoke is a Ruby implementation written in Rust and Ruby. Artichoke intends
to be [MRI-compatible][ruby-spec] and targets Ruby 2.6.3. Artichoke provides a
Ruby runtime implemented in Rust and Ruby.

## Try Artichoke

You can [try Artichoke in your browser][playground]. The [Artichoke
Playground][playground-repo] runs a [WebAssembly] build of Artichoke.

## Install Artichoke

### Prebuilt nightly binaries

[Download a prebuilt binary from artichoke/nightly][nightlies]. Binaries are
available for Linux, Linux/musl, macOS, and Windows.

These daily binaries track the latest trunk branch of Artichoke.

Binaries are also distributed through [ruby-build]. To install with [rbenv]:

```bash
rbenv install artichoke-dev
```

### Cargo

You can install a pre-release build of Artichoke using `cargo`, Rust's package
manager, by running:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/artichoke/artichoke --branch trunk --locked artichoke
```

To install via `cargo install` or to checkout and build locally, you'll need
Rust and clang. [`BUILD.md`](BUILD.md) has more detail on
[how to set up the compiler toolchain](BUILD.md#prerequisites).

### Docker

[Artichoke is available on Docker Hub][docker-hub].

You can launch a REPL by running:

```sh
docker run -it docker.io/artichokeruby/artichoke airb
```

## Usage

Artichoke ships with two binaries: `airb` and `artichoke`.

### `airb`

`airb` is the Artichoke implementation of `irb` and is an interactive Ruby shell
and [REPL].

`airb` is a readline-enabled shell, although it does not persist history.

## `artichoke`

`artichoke` is the `ruby` binary frontend to Artichoke.

`artichoke` supports executing programs via files, stdin, or inline with one or
more `-e` flags.

Artichoke can `require`, `require_relative`, and `load` files from the local
filesystem, but otherwise does not yet support local filesystem access. A
temporary workaround is to inject data into the interpreter with the
`--with-fixture` flag, which reads file contents into a `$fixture` global.

```console
$ artichoke --help
artichoke 0.1.0-pre.0
Artichoke is a Ruby made with Rust.

USAGE:
    artichoke [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] [--] [programfile]

FLAGS:
        --copyright    print the copyright
    -h, --help         Prints help information
    -V, --version      Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -e <commands>...                one line of script. Several -e's allowed. Omit [programfile]
        --with-fixture <fixture>    file whose contents will be read into the `$fixture` global

ARGS:
    <programfile>
```

## Design and Goals

Artichoke is [designed to enable experimentation](VISION.md). The top goals of
the project are:

- [Support WebAssembly as a build target][o-wasm].
- Support embedding and executing Ruby in untrusted environments.
- [Distribute Ruby applications as single-binary artifacts][a-single-binary].
- [Implement Ruby with state-of-the-art dependencies][a-deps].
- Experiment with VMs to support [dynamic codegen][a-codegen], [ahead of time
  compilation][a-compiler], [parallelism and eliminating the
  GIL][a-parallelism], and novel [memory management and garbage collection
  techniques][a-memory-management].

## Contributing

Artichoke aspires to be a Ruby 2.6.3-compatible implementation of the Ruby
programming language. [There is lots to do][github-issues].

If Artichoke does not run Ruby source code in the same way that MRI does, it is
a bug and we would appreciate if you [filed an issue so we can fix
it][file-an-issue].

If you would like to contribute code üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª, find an issue that looks interesting
and leave a comment that you're beginning to investigate. If there is no issue,
please file one before beginning to work on a PR. [Good first issues are labeled
`E-easy`][e-easy].
