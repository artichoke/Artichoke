Helpers for persisting Artichoke `airb` REPL history to disk.

This crate provides platform support for resolving the Artichoke Ruby `airb`
REPL's application data folder and path to a history file within it.

## Platform Support

On macOS, the history file is located in the current user's Application Support
directory.

On Windows, the history file is located in the current user's `LocalAppData`
known folder.

On Linux and other non-macOS Unix targets, the history file is located in the
`XDG_STATE_HOME` according to the [XDG Base Directory Specification], with the
specified fallback if the environment variable is not set.

[xdg base directory specification]:

```toml
[dependencies]

```

And parse Readline editing mode like this:

```rust
use artichoke_repl_history::repl_history_file;

if let Some(hist_file) = repl_history_file() {

}
```
